## Getting started

To install this app:

- Clone repo.
- Create a .env file based on **.env.example** and fill APP_KEY, APP_URL and MIX_ASSET_URL.
- Create a database and configure it on **.env**.
- Run `php artisan migrate`
- Run `php artisan db:seed` (only if you want demo data)

### Special Environment Variables

- **APP_PROXY_URL**: Only set this variable when you are using proxies and you need laravel to use a forced URL instead of resolving it automatically. Because proxies sometimes mess up with the final origin php will get at the end.
- **ASSET_URL**: To force the assets URL to be used by laravel. Usually automatic resolving works fine, but it may be necessary to set it with reverse proxies.
- **MIX_ASSET_URL**: To set url generated by mix() function.
- **RELATIVE_PUBLIC_PATH**: To set the public folder location relative to app folder. For example when you install the app outside apache's document root directory you will have to mantein only the public folder.
- **DOCKER_HOST_TARGET_PORT**: To change the host port in which docker container will be attached. This is usefull when you have already running another containers on this app default port.
